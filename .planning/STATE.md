# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** Every script runs reliably, recovers from failures, and has tests proving it works
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Code Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Code Hardening)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-02-23 — Plan 01-04 complete: Supabase graded_path update (GAP-10) added to video_color_grade.py

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 17%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 2.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.17 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-code-hardening | 4 | 10 min | 2.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 01-02 (3 min), 01-03 (3 min), 01-04 (1 min)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Checkpoint files for resume (GAP-11): JSON manifest per mission dir, atomic writes, skip completed items — IMPLEMENTED (01-03)
- video_qa.py --mission-path optional arg: defaults to CWD since script has no positional mission_path (01-03)
- checkpoint key for video_qa: Supabase asset UUID, not file path — stable across file renames (01-03)
- pytest for testing: Industry standard, rich assertion introspection, fixture support
- Mock external services in tests: Can't call real Supabase/Drive/FFmpeg in CI
- Logging pattern: LOG_DIR constant + dual FileHandler+StreamHandler in setup_logging(log_dir=LOG_DIR) (01-01)
- datetime.UTC class attribute used (not timezone.utc) — Python 3.11+ compatible, no extra imports (01-01)
- Z-suffix preserved in webhook payloads via .replace("+00:00","Z") — n8n expects Z not +00:00 (01-01)
- Exit code semantics: 0=full success, 1=partial failure, 2=fatal/all-failed — maps to n8n retry/alert/continue (01-02)
- Fatal exit pattern: log.error(msg) + sys.exit(2) — never sys.exit(string) (01-02)
- video_qa fail severity = failed, pass+review = ok — review-flagged clips still usable (01-02)
- [Phase 01-04]: Upsert (on_conflict=mission_id,filename) used for graded_path — safe before video_metadata.py runs
- [Phase 01-04]: --upload is opt-in; grading without --upload is 100% unchanged (GAP-10 closed)
- [Phase 01-04]: Supabase unique constraint on video_assets(mission_id,filename): not verifiable in CI — Phase 4 tests should mock or verify

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 and 4 both depend on Phase 2 but are independent of each other — can run in parallel
- ~~GAP-11 (checkpoint resume) is the most complex hardening task~~ RESOLVED — completed in 3 min (01-03)
- `platform_detect.py` unit tests (UNIT-02) require EXIF fixture files or mock pyexiftool — plan for fixture setup time

## Session Continuity
